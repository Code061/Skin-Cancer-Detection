# Skin-Cancer-Detection
Skin cancer detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) involves training a deep learning model to classify images of skin lesions as either cancerous or non-cancerous. CNNs are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images.
